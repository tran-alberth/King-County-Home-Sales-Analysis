# King-County-Home-Sales-Analysis

The goal of the project was to analyze the housing market in the King County, Washington, to identify the main contributing factors factors that influence home sales prices with Python and Tableau.

## Introduction:
For many people such as first-time homeowners, choosing a house may prove to be difficult. How do we know if the value of a house is worth it's price? Does the age of the house matter? Does the amount of living space contribute to the high price tag? Or does the house being in a gated neighborhood matter more?

These are all potential factors that may impact the price of a property, but which characteristic has the most impact? 

## Objective:
The analysis was conducted to investigate how different features impact property value by identifying the most significant factors that impact home sales prices. The analysis used data relative to home sales prices in the King County, Washington from April 2014 to May 2015. This county includes 39 cities, with Seattle being the largest (and county seat).
